        <h1>Flexboxes</h1>
        <p>with the power of CSS, you can do a lot of crazy stuff on your webpage with the help of <b>Flexboxes</b></p>
        <p>as such, I'll be teaching you about 3 different flexbox item properties, and 3 flexbox container properties. let's start with item properties.</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>Item Property 1: Order</h2>
        <p>if you would, please take a glance at the boxes below:</p>
        <div class="flex-container" >
            <div style="order: 3">1</div>
            <div style="order: 1">2</div>
            <div style="order: 4">3</div>
            <div style="order: 2">4</div>
        </div>
        <p>at first glace, it seems like all I did was change the box names to be out of normal order.
        <br>however, let's get a closer look at the code...</p>
        <img src="images/Order.png" alt="Order code">
        <p>
            the boxes are technically in the right order, but are being switched based on the values assigned to the order property.
            <br> so with the order property, we can rearange flexbox items on the fly without multiple copies, pastes, and deletes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Item Property 2: Flex-Grow</h2>
        <p>
            ever wanted one of your flexbox items to grow faster than the others?
            <br>(considering you're here, the answer is most likely no, but for the purpose of this segment just say yes)
            <br>WELL NOW YOU CAN!
            <br> observe the boxes below, and play around with window size a bit.
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div style="flex-grow: 1">1</div>
            <div style="flex-grow: 8">2</div>
            <div style="flex-grow: 1">3</div>
          </div>
        <p>No matter what, it seems like 2 is growing at a faster rate, staying multiple sizes larger than the other boxes</p>
        <img src="images/flex-grow.png" alt="flex grow code">
        <p>
            using the flex-growth property, we can adjust the rate at which a flex item grows relative to other items.
            <br> a similar tag is flex-shrink, which determines the rate at which it shrinks relative to others!
            <br> to activate it, set it up similar to above, but replace "flex-grow" with "flex-shrink".
            <br> one last note is that both will take up the length of the screen by default
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Item Property 3: Flex-Basis</h2>
        <p>
            the Flex Basis property is defenitely one of the simpler properties
            <br>using it, you can set the initial length of any specific boxes to something that isn't the original
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div>1</div>
            <div>2</div>
            <div>3</div>
            <div style="flex-basis: 200px">4</div>
        </div>
        <p>to accomplish this, simply give one of the divs the "flex-basis" property, then set it to whatever you want!</p>
        <img src="images/Flex-Basis.png" alt="flex-basis code">
        <p> furthermore, unlike Flex-grow, the altered item will keep it's general length compared to the other boxes 
            <br> so when you want 
        </p>
