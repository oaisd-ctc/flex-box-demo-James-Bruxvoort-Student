        <h1>Flexboxes</h1>
        <p>with the power of CSS, you can do a lot of crazy stuff on your webpage with the help of <b>Flexboxes</b></p>
        <p>as such, I'll be teaching you about 3 different flexbox item properties, and 3 flexbox container properties. let's start with item properties.</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>Item Property 1: Order</h2>
        <p>if you would, please take a glance at the boxes below</p>
        <div class="flex-container" >
            <div style="order: 3">1</div>
            <div style="order: 1">2</div>
            <div style="order: 4">3</div>
            <div style="order: 2">4</div>
        </div>
        <p>at first glace, it seems like all I did was change the box names to be out of normal order.
        <br>however, let's get a closer look at the code...</p>
        <!--insert image of the code here!-->
        <p>
            the boxes are technically in the right order, but are being switched based on the values assigned to the order property
            <br> so with the order property, we can rearange flexbox items on the fly without multiple copies, pastes, and deletes
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Item Property 2: Flex-Grow</h2>
        <p>
            ever wanted one of your flexbox items to grow faster than the others?
            <br>(considering you're here, the answer is most likely no, but for the purpose of this segment just say yes)
